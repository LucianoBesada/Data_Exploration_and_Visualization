# Ford GoBike System Data

Tools useful for analysis: *Python* and *Jupyter Notebook.*
## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
It is composed by 17 columns and 183,412 rows from users based in San Francisco. It gives information about 4,646 number of bikes and 329 start and end stations.
To make better analysis I discarded users that have or have declared an age over 80. And took into consideration only trips that had different start and ending stations, all this due to geolocalization reasons. <br>
Some data wrangling was necessary to clean up the data, to extract the age all users and to know the distance they have been using their bikes.

## Summary of Findings

During the exploratory analysis, I have found that one of the reasons for success for the rental service is due to their locations in different main points in San Francisco, locations that sum up to 329 stations, and the availability of 4,646 bikes. <br>
In addition, I notice how the service is used mostly by men with an age between 27 and 33 years old. <br>
However, even if the service is taken mostly by men, in general women seem to enjoy more their rides by covering longer distances per ride.


## Key Insights for Presentation

During the presentation, I will first focus to show a general pattern of what days the bike rental service is taken. From where, by highlighting the main points of interest, and by who. 
This last point will be additionally analyzed to discover the composition of the users, their age, and the distance they cover by taking a ride. 
We will see that people benefit most from the service by buying an annual subscription and using it essentially to go to work.
